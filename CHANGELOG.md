## [Unreleased]

Initial public release preparation. This is an AWS-native, open-source reference
framework that unifies the GraphRAG and LightRAG retrieval methodologies on
Amazon Bedrock, Neptune, OpenSearch, and DynamoDB.

### Added
- Two selectable retrieval methodologies: GraphRAG community-summary
  (`auto`/`drift`/`global`/`local`/`simple`) and LightRAG dual-level keyword
  (`mix`/`hybrid`/`naive`), sharing one ingestion/indexing/caching/hybrid-search
  stack.
- Incremental indexing via a DynamoDB document-status registry (content-hash
  diff, idempotent upserts, per-document lineage for deletion).
- Triple-hybrid retrieval (lexical + semantic + graph) with RRF fusion and
  Bedrock reranking; multilingual ingestion and retrieval.
- CLIs: `run-ingestion`, `run-rag`, `run-eval`, `run-visualization`,
  `run-prompt-tuning`.
- CDK deployment stack (`iac/`) with Well-Architected security defaults.

### Fixed
- The gleaner now applies the `ENTITY_CORRECTION` and `RELATIONSHIP_CORRECTION`
  issues `GraphRefinementPrompt` asks for (wrong entity name or type, wrong
  relationship type or direction). Issue dispatch branched only on the two
  `MISSING_*` types, so every correction the model returned was discarded, and
  gleaning could only ever add to the graph, never fix it. The prompt now also
  specifies the `<details>` shape for both correction types, which it previously
  requested without defining.
